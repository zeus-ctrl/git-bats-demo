# A set of incremental tests that will hopefully guide you
# through the development of a simple shell script. If you
# run these tests (`bats bats_tests.sh`) and work on the
# first failing test until it passes, you should eventually
# get all the tests to pass, at which point you will hopefully
# have a working script. If you're unclear on how to deal with
# any particular passing test, search the Internet or ask a
# question! You certainly shouldn't spend more than a few minutes
# on any of these sub-tasks.
